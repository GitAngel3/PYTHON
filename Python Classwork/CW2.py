"""
You work for a bookstore that generates receipts for customers. Your task is to prepare a simple receipt using string techniques.
Here’s what you need to do:
Create a multiline string to store the receipt header.
The customer bought 2 items:
Book Title: "Python Basics" – ₹450
Book Title: "Data Science Intro" – ₹600
For each line showing the book and price, use a single string with basic {} placeholders and call format() once to fill in the values.
Calculate the total price and add it similarly.
Concatenate a thank-you message at the end.
Make sure the output uses newline (\n) and tab (\t) for readability.
Display the entire receipt in uppercase.
