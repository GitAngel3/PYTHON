#Your task:
#Store the volume of each juice in separate variables.
#Calculate the total volume sold.
#Print the total volume.
#Convert the total volume to an integer and print it.
#Convert the total volume to a string and print it with a message.
#Add a random number between 5 and 10 (representing additional bonus liters) and print the final total

a= "apple"=15.5
b="orange"=20
c="grape"=10.25
total_vol=a+b+c
